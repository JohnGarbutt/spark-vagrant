# spark-vagrant
Standalone spark using ansible and vagrant

To use the vagrant file, you will need to have done the following:

  1. Download and Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
  2. Download and Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
  3. Install [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html)
  4. Open a shell prompt (Terminal app on a Mac) and cd into the folder containing the `Vagrantfile`
  5. Run the following command to install the necessary Ansible roles for this profile: `$ ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml`
  6. Run the following command to install vagrant plugins: `$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager`

Once all of that is done, you can simply type in `vagrant up`, and Vagrant will create a new VM, install the base box, and configure it.

Once the new VM is up and running (after `vagrant up` is complete and you're back at the command prompt), you can log into it via SSH if you'd like by typing in `vagrant ssh`.
